            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe long lookt for Reformation of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, hath been the expectation of mo≈øt men: happy they at fir≈øt that could but put a finger, or adde a mite to this great and glorious work, or (as fal≈øly and bla≈øphemou≈øly) the work of the Lord. How forward was the holy City of <hi>London</hi> to bring forth their Trea≈øure for the advancing of ≈øo pious a De≈øigne, their Money, Plate, Jewels were not wanting; the common ≈øort of people thought we ≈øhould have had a golden Age, that it ≈øhould have been with them as in the dayes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to have ≈øilver and gold as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull as ≈øtones in the ≈øtreet; their zeal was ≈øo hot, that it ever eat up many of them, they cannot recover it to this day. The mo≈øt part of the Kingdom hath been deluded with vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of truth in Religion, of liberty and property, of all earthly happine≈ø≈øe that might be; they expected <hi>England</hi> to have become a ≈øecond Paradi≈øe. But what the Proverb of old, is now to our ≈øorrow found too true, the remedy of the≈øe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Reformation is wor≈øe then the di≈øea≈øe; the two Hou≈øes have ≈øate above ≈øeven yeers to hatch Cocatrices and Vipers, they have filled the Kingdom with Serpents, blood-thir≈øtie Souldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, extorting Committees, Seque≈øtrators, Exci≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; all the Rogues and ≈øcumme of the Kingdom have they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161373:3"/>≈øet on work to torment and vex the people, to rob them, and to eat the bread out of their mouthes; they have rai≈øed a cau≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe and unnaturall Warre again≈øt their own Soveraigne Lord and King, a mo≈øt pious Chri≈øtian Prince, contrary to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and duty, and have ≈øhed innocent blood in this Land. Religion is onely talkt of, nothing done; they have put down what is good, and (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> heretofore did) they lead us in an implicite blinde way, we know not what Faith to profe≈ø≈øe. Nay, Here≈øies and bla≈øphemies condemned in Generall Councils long before Popery had any growth in the Chri≈øtian Church, are revived; and though not publickly owned by our Reformers, yet winkt at, or at lea≈øt left unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed. The Civill Government is doubtfull: our fundamentall Laws ≈øo much talkt of in this pretended Reformation, are now become onely the Votes of the two Hou≈øes: if they be plea≈øed to take away our lives and fortunes by a Vote, (as they did ≈øome of our dear Countreymen for performing their duty) it is Law, though we never come to triall: the liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject (≈øo much contended for) is wholly theirs, we but va≈ø≈øals and ≈ølaves to their will; and their will is now our Law. There is now little mention made of the King in any of their proceedings; they voted Him long ≈øince not to be in a condition to govern: it is conjectured by us plain Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they e≈øteem him but as a conquer'd Prince, ≈øubject now to their mercy; if he could e≈øcape with life it were well; all Power and Authority is now monopolited and confined within the verge of our omnipotent (yet mon≈øtrous) Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The greate≈øt ≈øcruple is what to do, or how to di≈øpo≈øe of this heavie burden of the Kingdom, the King; if they ≈øhould depo≈øe him, or take away his life, they fear the people, becau≈øe mo≈øt of them yet take him for their King: they have (≈øince he came within their power) endeavoured to vex and grieve him, by the debarring him of the ≈øociety and comfort of his Royall Con≈øort, the enjoyment of his children, the attendance of his faithfull Nobility and Coun≈øellors, by removing his tru≈øtie ≈øervants from him, denying any acce≈ø≈øe of his loyall Subjects unto him, keeping ≈øtrict guards about him, urging him to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161373:3"/>≈øigning of ≈øuch Propo≈øitions, which might render him odious to his Subjects (As they have ju≈øtly made them≈øelves already) and the ≈øcorne of all Kings and Nations: and the end of all this is, to break his heart, and ≈øhorten his life; for that is the onely way to ≈øecure their own lives and e≈øtates. They would hold the people in hand, that they are labouring to ≈øettle peace in this Kingdome, to releive <hi>Ireland</hi> and keepe union with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> But we under≈øtand that <hi>Scotland</hi> is not plea≈øed, <hi>Ireland</hi> to our knowledge is not releived, and this Kingdom much di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and mi≈øerably divided. If Peace be ≈øo neer unto us (as is pretended) why have they voted a ≈øtanding army of ≈øo many thou≈øands to the further grievance and impoveri≈øhing of the Land? Wherefore continue they ≈øo many u≈øele≈ø≈øe garri≈øons and County troopes? Why lay they greater taxes upon the people, and yet burthen them with free quarter? The charge of the Kingdom is increa≈øed, and yet they promi≈øe us ≈øudden peace: Surely they mu≈øt acknowledge, that either they expect a forain enemy, or el≈øe intend to act ≈øuch de≈øperate things again≈øt the King and Kingdom, as may ju≈øtly provoke another war here by in≈øurrection of the people. And it is very well known, that the eyes of mo≈øt of the people of this land are opened, and they fully di≈øcerne now their own weakne≈ø≈øe in being over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the wickedne≈ø≈øe of the two Hou≈øes in ≈øeducing them under ≈øpecious pretences, of Religion, Liberty, property and what not? They have deluded the <hi>Scots</hi> al≈øo with the ≈øame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and engaged them in that cau≈øe of which the <hi>Scots</hi> begin now to repent, and be a≈øhamed, and are ready to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the wrong done them by the two Hou≈øes, as al≈øo to re≈øtore the Kings Maje≈øtie to his ju≈øt rights, who is now impri≈øoned by them in the Ile of <hi>Wight:</hi> to which de≈øigne of the <hi>Scots</hi> ≈øignified in their late Declaration we are ready to joyne our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and de≈øire the concurrence of all his Maje≈øties loyall Subjects within this Kingdome, as hereafter we ≈øhall more fully expre≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>The cau≈øe of this ≈øo ≈øudden a po≈øture of defence which we have put our ≈øelves into, was the violent proceedings of the Mayor of this City of <hi>Carterbury</hi> and his uncivill carriage in per≈øuance of ≈øome petty order of the Hou≈øe of Commons for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161373:4"/>hindering the celebration of Chri≈øts Nativity ≈øo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church of God. That which we ≈øo much de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that day was but a Sermon, which any other day of the weeke was tollerable by the orders &amp; practi≈øe of the two Hou≈øes and all their adherents, but that day (becau≈øe it was Chri≈øts birth day) we mu≈øt have none; that which is good all the yeer long, yet is this day ≈øuper≈øtitious. The Mayor cau≈øing ≈øome of us to be beaten contrary to his oath and office, who ought to pre≈øerve the peace, and to that purpo≈øe chiefly is the ≈øword of Ju≈øtice put into his hands, and wrongfully impri≈øoned divers of us, becau≈øe we did a≈ø≈øemble our ≈øelves to hear the word of God, which he was plea≈øed to interpret a Ryot; yet we were unarmed, behaved our ≈øelves civilly, intended no ≈øuch tumult as afterwards we were forc'd unto: but at la≈øt ≈øeeing the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt wrong done to our children, ≈øervants, and neighbours, by beating, wounding, and impri≈øoning them, we were moved to vindicate the wrong done them, and to relea≈øe them that were impri≈øoned, and did call unto our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance our brethren of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> who very readily came in to us, and have a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øociated them≈øelves to us in this our ju≈øt and lawfull defence, and do concurre with us in this our Remon≈øtrance concerning the Kings Maje≈øtie, and the ≈øettlement of Peace in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Fora≈ømuch therefore as the two Hou≈øes have exceedingly erred in exalting their priviledges above the Kings Prerogative, and outgone all former Pre≈øidents in Parliament, by exerci≈øing an Arbitrary power and government over their fellow ≈øubjects, have rai≈øed an unju≈øt War again≈øt our Soveraigne Lord and King, and de≈øtroyed many of the Nobility, Gentrie, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie of the Land, have unju≈øtly murthered (though execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Malefactors) many of his Maje≈øties loyall Subjects, ≈øome of our own County al≈øo, have ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed the true Prote≈øtant Religion, ≈øuffered all kinds of Here≈øies and Errors in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have impri≈øoned or at lea≈øt ≈øilenced and put down all the Orthodox C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
